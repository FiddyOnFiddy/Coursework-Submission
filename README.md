===========

**Branches worked on:**

**Matthew's Branch** - This is the final branch with all my work put together

**First Component Branch** - I started the component system

**Skybox Working** - I added in a skybox

**Texture/Lighting Shader** - Added in a shader to handle specular lighting with textures

**Cell Shading** - Implemented cell shading and the particle system


**Note: Partical System branch is to be ignored. Accidently commited particle changes to the Cell shading branch.**
